# SSHA (salted SHA passwords)

This is a utility library to use with openldap.  I originally wanted
to use bcrypt because I searched the internet too much, but on reading
the docs for openldap I discovered that the best available was "SSHA".

The code is mostly just an adaptation of the Perl code found at
<http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/347.html>.  One of the tests
in fact checks the expected output of 'secret' with password 'salt'
against the output of the Perl program.

My application needs to use CAS  <http://www.jasig.org/cas> backed by
ldap, and so I cannot use anything other than the password schemes
supported out of the box by openldap.


# Tests

Three fairly simple tests have been added.  First whether 'secret' and
'salt' make the expected hash, then whether a random password and salt
can be encoded and decoded, and finally whether a known hash
generated by slappasswd for the password 'secret' can be properly
verified.

I use mocha for the tests; `npm install` followed by `make test`
should run them.
